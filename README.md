# XO is Unbeatable

> A tic-tac-toe game playing against an AI, you can now try beating it [here](https://photkosee.github.io/xo-is-unbeatable/).

## Background

Last week I was introduced about an AI playing tic-tac-toe using Minimax algorithm during my AI class. I was exciting and planed to bring it to live. Since building a tic-tac-toe on frontend is not going to take long and I enjoy doing frontend a lot. Now it is a good time for me to get a well understanding on this algorithm.

## Minimax Algorithm

When we have 2 players, each try to find an optimal move. So, it's best to assume that the other player would pick his most optimal move (minimizing)
